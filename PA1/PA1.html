                    The Internet and the Word Wide Web, although separate terms, 
                    have gone a lot of major changes in the past decades. These two 
                    revolutionized the world in ways people couldn't have possibly 
                    imagined 50 years before. Of course, as technology and its impact 
                    grew, the original designs became diluted. The Internet blossomed 
                    into possibly the greatest sweeping transformation in the history 
                    of communications technology. Meanwhile, the World Wide Web evolved 
                    from a vehicle intended to integrate the Internet and democratize 
                    electronically based information into a commercial behemoth that 
                    changed the way businesses are done.

                        <p class="text">
                            In 1962, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/J-C-R-Licklider" target="_blank">Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider</a> dreamed about creating a <em>''Galactic Network''</em>
                            where computers across the globe are connected. He wants to distribute 
                            and access data and programs. Fast forward, the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/" target="_blank">Defense Advanced Research 
                            Projects Agency (DARPA)</a>, the original research into what became the modern 
                            internet, was launched and Licklider became it's first director. He 
                            envisioned the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/ARPANET#:~:text=ARPANET%2C%20in%20full%20Advanced%20Research,the%20forerunner%20of%20the%20Internet.&text=Its%20initial%20purpose%20was%20to,research%20institutions%20over%20telephone%20lines." target="_blank">Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)</a> which 
                            became the first version of the Internet. Multiple advancements were made 
                            in the 1960s including the introduction to packet switching as proposed by Kleinrock

                            The ARPANET's first computer operated at the Kleinrock's Network Measurement Center 
                            at the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1969. The other nodes were then 
                            added at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), UC Santa Barbara (UCSB), and the University 
                            of Utah in Salt Lake City.

                            As more and more computers were added to the network, the need for a communication 
                            protocol also arose. The host-to-host <em>Network Control Protocol (NCP)</em> was rolled out in 
                            1970 to solve this problem and thus, this made the internet bloom.

                            The fate of the internet ultimately changed in 1972 when <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-Elliot-Kahn" target="_blank">Robert Kahn</a> of Bolt Beranek and Newman 
                            (BBN), who is one of the chief figures in the development of the ARPANET architecture, organized 
                            a conference at the <abbr title="International Computer Communication Conference">ICCC</abbr> where ARPANET was 
                            first demonstrated publicly. In the same year, the electronic mail was introduced to public, 
                            also known as <em>e-mail</em>.

                            The rapid expansion of the Internet in the 1980s necessitated new methods of management such as the 
                            <em>Domain Name System (DNS)</em>. In its earliest incarnations, users had to memorize numerical addresses to 
                            access the fairly limited number of host networks, but that became unfeasible as the number of 
                            connected networks took off. With the proliferation of <em>local area networks (LANs)</em>, Internet managers 
                            designed the DNS to create easily identifiable hierarchies of hosts to facilitate easy Internet 
                            navigation.

                            National Research Council committee report titled "Towards a National Research Network," paved 
                            the way for the next steps of Internet evolution, including the sponsorship by the U.S. government 
                            of high-speed computer networks that would serve as the backbone for the explosion of the information 
                            super-highway and e-commerce in the 1990s.

                            Perhaps the invention that most facilitated the growth of the Internet as a global 
                            information-sharing system is the World Wide Web. Unlike the Internet, however, the 
                            early design and development of the <em>World Wide Web</em> was primarily the doing of just 
                            one person: <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/" target="_blank">Tim Berners-Lee</a>. Working as a contract programmer at the Geneva, 
                            Switzerland-based Centre Europen de Recherche Nucleaire (European Laboratory for 
                            Particle Physics, or CERN), Berners-Lee repeatedly proposed to develop a global 
                            interactive interface for use on the Internet so as to turn the fragmented and 
                            relatively exclusive Internet into a popular and seamless whole. After several 
                            rejections, Berners-Lee simply developed a prototype using the laboratory's phone-book 
                            entries in 1989. Called Enquire Within Upon Everything, the prototype was designed to 
                            link and connect elements much in the way that the brain makes random connections and 
                            associations. Unlike the average database system, according to Berners-Lee, the Web 
                            was to be designed to make random associations between arbitrary objects in the files.

                            Taking advantage of the Internet's gateways and bypassing centralized registries, 
                            Berners-Lee devised the <em>universal resource locators (URLs)</em> that are the basis for 
                            Web addresses under the DNS. URLs were built to highlight the central power of the 
                            Web: that any link can connect to any other document or resource anywhere on the 
                            Internet, or in the "universe of information," as Berners-Lee puts it. URLs are structured 
                            to identify the kind of space that is being accessed (for instance, by the prefixes "http:" 
                            or "ftp:") followed by the specific address within that information space.

                            The last piece of the WWW puzzle was the medium's lingua franca: <em>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</em>, 
                            a language of codes, built on hypermedia principles dating back to the 1940s, that informs the 
                            browser how to interpret the files for the Web. By 1991, all the elements were in place, and the 
                            World Wide Web was released from Berners-Lee's laboratory to the public free of any charge.

                            Beginning in the mid-1990s, the World Wide Web helped propel the Internet to a new stage of mass 
                            consumption, and in the process both were radically transformed, as was the society that used them. 
                            The Internet and World Wide Web opened new fields of debate over social and cultural concerns, 
                            including the right to privacy, the protection of children from harmful or inappropriate materials, 
                            freedom of speech as it pertains to electronic networks, intellectual property, issues of social 
                            equality, the security of financial and personal data online, and a host of other issues.

                            the race to take advantage of the emerging e-commerce markets highlighted the needs of commercial

                            models structured on Internet communications and technology. In turn, businesses used these 
                            technologies as tools to enter and take advantage of new markets throughout the world, in the process 
                            furthering the proliferation of the Internet and the globalization of the world's economies. In the

                            groups wrangled to assert their positions, and consensus over the future direction of these technologies 
                            was far from realization, there was little doubt that the Internet and the World Wide Web were thoroughly
